A platform for Gophers similar to the awesome [Golang News](http://golangnews.com).

## Why ?

Droplets is NOT built because there is no such platform nor is it built to solve problems
with existing platforms.

New gophers often struggle with deciding how to structure their applications and also miss certain
important conventions (e.g., `Accept Interfaces, Return Structs`).


Droplets is built to showcase:

1. A manageable [Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout/)
2. Application of [CodeReviewComments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) and [EffectiveGo](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
3. Usage of Clean Architecture
