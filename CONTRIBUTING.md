# Contributing to Droplets

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. You are Awesome! :heart:

Droplets is built to showcase ideas, patterns and best practices which can be
applied while building cool stuff with Go.

## What can I contribute and How ?

A project with realistic development cycle is required to be able to demonstrate
different ideas as applicable in real-world scenarios. This means, any type of
contribution that a typical open-source project would go through are welcome here.

Some possible contributions:

- Suggest features to add
- Suggest improvements to code
- Suggest improvements to documentation
- Open an issue and discuss a practice used
- Try the project and report bugs
- Designs for the web app

Or any other contribution you can think of (And be sure to send a PR to add it to
this document, which itself is another contribution!)

You can simply follow the guidelines from [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

## Responsibilities

* No platform specific code
* Ensure that any code you add follows [CodeReviewComments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments), [EffectiveGo](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) and [Clean Architecture](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
* Keep PRs as small as possible to make it easy to review and discuss.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.
* Code change PRs must have unit tests
