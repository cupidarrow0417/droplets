// Package internal is the root package for non-reusable components of the
// application (e.g. stores, usecases etc.). Similar to `pkg`, this package
// should not contain any entities (exported or otherwise) since a package
// named 'internal' does not express its purpose and could become a catch
// all or a dumping ground for things that do not belong.
